Now that we have an idea of what's ahead in our culinary journey, let's begin by breaking down the simplest part of cooking and eventually enjoying eating your own food, because remember that's your end goal! The cooking can be over simplified if you just understand *taste, texture, and your personal preferences*. If you were suprised to see the personal preference part, yes, personal preferences matter :) Let's dive in and break these down in simplistic terms.

## Introduction 

One would almost never put Soy Sauce into Paneer Butter Masala, right? or Rajma in Poha? You can try and eventually might create a stellar dish using *not-so-friendly* ingredients. But that's besides the point. Somehow you have that instinct of what works and what doesn't, right? How did you develop that instict? Over the years of tasting food you would have developed your senses to recognize a pattern in each and every dish you taste. You would't expect your pizza to taste like Sambar-rice, right? That would be asburd. So inherently by just eating you already know what works and what doesn't. We are just going to tap into those subconciscous flavour profiles and  use it in the food that we cook. 

If you have no idea what I introduced to you, then you probably need to start focusing more on what you eat :) Anyhow, I got you covered, we will start from the absolute foundations.

## Tasty food?



### What works and what doesn't?
