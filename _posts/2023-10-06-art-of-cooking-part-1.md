In this series of articles and *vegetarian/vegan* recipes, I'm here to spill the beans on how you can whip up low-effort delicious, nutritious meals without emptying your pockets. Say goodbye to the hassle of eating out and embrace the joy of home cooking that won't break the bank. So, let's dive in and uncover the secrets of eating like a king on a budget!

## Introduction

Alright, folks, let's talk about something we've all faced at one point or another – the dreaded task of cooking for ourselves, especially if you're a bachelor or part of a couple with a crazy busy life. Now, don't get me wrong; I get it. The kitchen can seem like a daunting place. But hang on a sec, because I've got some great news for you. It doesn't have to be that way! In the paragraphs ahead, I'm going to spill the beans on how you can whip up homely, easy, and wallet-friendly meals without breaking a sweat. And guess what? These meals will not only satisfy your taste buds but also set you on the path to a healthier lifestyle. If your daily routine includes ordering take-out or dining out, it's time for a change. Just put in a smidge of effort into cooking your meals a few times a week, and trust me, you'll start noticing some positive changes in no time. Stick with me to find out just how simple and satisfying this journey can be.


## Why should you cook? 

Why in the world should you bother cooking? Well, here's the scoop: when I started cooking, I noticed some pretty cool things happening *to me*. Now, I'm not saying these points are going to blow your socks off, but hey, they might just nudge you towards a slightly better lifestyle!

+ *Stress Buster*: Believe it or not, cooking can be your secret weapon against stress. It's not just about getting away from the screen for a bit (although that's a win), it's also about letting your creative side loose. Think of it as a mini art project that involves experimenting, planning, and some good old-fashioned organization. Plus, there's something therapeutic about it. So, the next time life's got you feeling frazzled, consider whipping up a meal – it could be your chill pill!

+ *Healthier & Happier*: Alright, so you might just become addicted to this cooking thing (don't say I didn't warn you). But it's a healthy kind of addiction. When you're the chef, you're the boss. You call the shots on what goes into your dishes. That means you can ditch the extra salt, sugar, and fat that restaurants love to pile on. Say goodbye to those sneaky additives and preservatives too. Plus, you'll be a pro at food safety. In just a few days, you'll feel lighter, healthier, and, dare I say, happier. After all, a healthier you is a happier you, right?

+ *Save Money*: Now, I won't get all accountant-like on you, but here's the deal – cooking won't break the bank. Sure, there's a small upfront investment in ingredients and a few cooking vessels, but that's about it. I won't dive into the nitty-gritty details just yet (I'll save that for another time), but trust me, once you start cooking – or even just read my posts – you'll see the savings roll in.

These are just a few thoughts off the top of my head, but there's more where that came from. If you've got your own cooking epiphanies, I'd love to hear 'em! Leave a comment and share the changes you've experienced since you started cooking. Let's chat!

## Why should you follow me?
 
I'm no culinary whiz, and I'm certainly not here to dazzle you with fancy dishes. I'm just your average bachelor who happens to enjoy cooking, and I'm on a mission to share that passion with you.

Let me take you on a quick trip down memory lane. It all started back in July 2022 when I was grinding away at my bachelor's thesis in Germany. Now, if you've ever been outside of India and tried the local food, you might know the feeling. European cuisine can sometimes be, well, a bit bland and wallet-draining. Eating out all the time wasn't an option, so my flatmates and I decided to take matters into our own hands.

We embarked on a culinary journey, taking turns cooking up homely dishes. Over time, we honed our skills, and cooking became a daily delight. In fact, we turned it into a tradition that lasted a solid six months. We were all about minimal ingredients and minimal cleanup because who wants to wash tons of dishes, right? The best part? We saved a boatload of cash, which we happily splurged on exploring Europe.

Cooking also became our ultimate stress-reliever after long hours in the lab. And that's where the inspiration for the "Why should you cook?" section comes from. You see, I'm no stranger to the incredible benefits of whipping up your meals.

Fast forward to today, I've settled down in Hyderabad after completing my internship in Germany, and I've got the best of both worlds – Indian ingredients and a bit more cash to play around with. It was around this time that I decided to start writing these posts. My goal? To share my experiences and help anyone who's keen on cooking homely, affordable meals.

Now, I'm not a chef, and I won't pretend to be one. I won't be whipping up gourmet dishes that require hours of labor and a ton of ingredients. Nope, my focus is on something different. I want to help you understand the intuition of cooking. Think of it as learning to ride a bike without training wheels. I'll show you the ropes so you can cook hearty and healthy meals on a budget, with minimal ingredients, and in record time.

So, why should you follow me?

+ *I Get the Bachelor Struggles*: I've been there, and I know what it's like to navigate the kitchen as a bachelor. No fancy dishes here, just nutritious, homely, and easy-to-cook meals.
It's About Intuition, Not Recipes: Forget complicated recipes with precise measurements. I'm here to teach you the art of cooking by intuition. 
+ *Off-the-Shelf Cooking*: We won't be reinventing the wheel here. We'll use off-the-shelf components to make your life easier. For example, making biryani? We'll skip the tedious process of making biryani masala from scratch and opt for a store-bought blend. We'll then tweak it to perfection.
+ *Cheap, Effortless, and Homely Recipes*: While I'm all about teaching the art of cooking, I'll do it through straightforward recipes.

It's about trusting your instincts, experimenting fearlessly, and adjusting flavors on the fly. I'll show you how to cook with heart and soul, just like Uncle Roger himself.
